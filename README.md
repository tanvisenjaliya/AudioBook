# AudioBook
# A Tableau Workbook
A company has been selling audiobooks online.
we have 2 files
one is about sales
another about reviews.

we have to create a table with both types of data: sales and reviews
If I manage to do that we'll be able to create several different charts in tableau that would allow

us to learn if the number of reviews the company receives has been growing.

How did the average review score change over time.

What is the percentage breakdown between 10 star 9 star 8 star and other types of reviews.

What percentage of people acquiring an audio book leave a review.

Visualize the correlation between audio book sales and number of reviews or perhaps visualize the correlation

between average review score and sales.


# solution

blending.

data source such as an Excel workbook or and SQL database.

Chart 1- Number of reviews and average rating

reviews LEFT and number of purchases in a given month
